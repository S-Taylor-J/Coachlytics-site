        <h1>Coachlytics Support</h1>

        <p>
            Welcome to Coachlytics — the hockey coaching and team management app.
            We're here to help you manage your team, track player time, and coach smarter.
        </p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <p><strong>How do I add players?</strong><br>
            Open the Team tab and tap the "+" button to add a new player. You can enter their name, jersey number,
            position(s), and skills.</p>

        <p><strong>How do I track player time during a game?</strong><br>
            Use the Pitch view to drag and drop players onto the field. The app automatically tracks how long each
            player has been on the pitch versus on the bench.</p>

        <p><strong>Can I manage multiple teams?</strong><br>
            Yes. You can create multiple teams and set a default team in Settings to control which players appear on the
            pitch by default.</p>

        <p><strong>How do I set up my formation?</strong><br>
            Go to the Pitch view and drag players from the bench to their positions on the field. You can configure the
            minimum number of players required on the pitch in Settings (default is 11).</p>

        <p><strong>How do I record game results?</strong><br>
            Navigate to the Games tab and tap "+" to create a new game. Enter the opponent, date, and location. After
            the game, you can record the final score and the result will be tracked in your season stats.</p>
